## About

***The scope of NUKI Hub is to have an efficient way to integrate NUKI Lock in a local Home Automation platform.***

The NUKI Hub software runs on any ESP32 module and acts as a bridge between a NUKI Lock and a Home Automation platform.
It communicates with the Nuki Lock via Bluetooth (BLE) and then uses MQTT to integrate with other systems.

It exposes the lock state (and more) via MQTT, and allows to execute commands like locking and unlocking.
Optionally, a NUKI Opener is also supported.

***NUKI Hub does not integrate with the NUKI mobile app, it can't register itself as a bridge in the official NUKI mobile app. ***

<br>
<b>Note for users upgrading from 8.21 or lower:</b> Please go to "MQTT and Network Configuration" and select
"Wifi only" as the network device (unless you use other network hardware).

## Installation

Flash the firmware to an ESP32. The easiest way to install is to use the web installer:<br>
https://technyon.github.io/nuki_hub/
<br>(Needs a web serial compatible browser like Chrome/Opera/Edge).

As an alternative, download a release:<br>
https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/releases
<br>Read the included readme.txt for installation instructions for either Espressif Flash Download Tools or esptool.

## Setup

The firmware uses the Wifi Manager to configure the WiFi network. Power up the ESP32, a new Access Point should appear. Connect to this access point and in a browser navigate to "192.168.4.1". Use the web interface configure your Wifi network.

After configuring the Wifi, the ESP should automatically connect to your network. Use the web interface to setup the MQTT broker; just navigate to the IP-Address assigned to the ESP32 via DHCP (often found in the web interface of the internet router).<br>
To configure MQTT, enter the adress of your MQTT broker and eventually a username and a password if required. The firmware supports SSL encryption for MQTT, however most people and especially home users don't use this. In that case leave all fields about "MQTT SSL" blank.<br>
If a PIN has been configured using the smartphone app, it's recommended to supply this PIN to NUKI Hub.
Certain functionality is not available without configuring the PIN, like changing the config or keypad coded.
To do so, navigate to "Credentials" in the web interface. This will only supply the PIN to NUK Hub, it will on no way reconfigure the PIN on the lock.

## Pairing

Just enable pairing mode on the NUKI lock (press button for a few seconds) and power on the ESP32. Pairing should be automatic. When pairing is successful, the web interface should show "Paired: Yes" (reload page in browser). MQTT nodes like lock state and battery level should now reflect the reported values from the lock.

Note: It is possible to run NUKI Hub alongside a NUKI Bridge. This is not recommended and can lead to either device missing updates. Enable "Register as app" before pairing to allow this. Otherwise the Bridge will be unregistered when pairing the NUKI Hub.

## Over-the-air Update (OTA)
After initially flashing the firmware via serial connection, further updates can be deployed via OTA update from a Web Browser. In the configuration portal, scroll down to "Firmware update" and click "Open". Then Click "Browse" and select the new "nuki_hub.bin" file and select "Upload file". After about a minute the new firmware should be installed.

## MQTT Encryption (optional; WiFi only)

The communication via MQTT can be SSL encrypted. To enable SSL encryption, supply the necessary information in the MQTT Configuration page.
The following configurations are supported:<br>

CA, CERT and KEY are empty -> No encryption<br>
CA is filled but CERT and KEY are empty -> Encrypted MQTT<br>
CA, CERT and KEY are filled -> Encrypted MQTT with client vaildation<br>

## Home Assistant Discovery (optional)

Home Assistant can be setup manually using the [MQTT Lock integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/lock.mqtt/).

For a simpler integration, this software supports [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/). To enable autodiscovery, supply the discovery topic that is configured in your Home Assistant instance (typically "homeassistant") in the MQTT Configuration page. Once enabled, Smartlock and/or Opener should automatically appear on Home Assistant.

The following mapping between Home Assistant services and Nuki commands is setup when enabling autodiscovery:
|             | Smartlock | Opener                    |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| lock.lock   | Lock      | Disable Ring To Open               |
| lock.unlock | Unlock    | Enable Ring To Open                |
| lock.open   | Unlatch   | Electric Strike Actuation |

NOTE: MQTT Discovery uses retained MQTT messages to store devices configurations. In order to avoid orphan configurations on your broker please disable autodiscovery first if you no longer want to use this SW. Retained messages are automatically cleared when unpairing and when changing/disabling autodiscovery topic in MQTT Configuration page.

## Keypad control (optional)

If a keypad is connected to the lock, keypad codes can be added, updated and removed.
This has to enabled first in the configuration portal. Check "Enabled keypad control via MQTT" and save the configuration.
After enabling keypad control, information about codes is published under "keypad/code_x", x starting from 0 up the number of configured codes.
<br>
For security reasons, the code itself is not published. To modify keypad codes, a command
structure is setup under keypad/command:

- keypad/command/id: The id of an existing code, found under keypad_code_x
- keypad/command/name: Display name of the code
- keypad/command/code: The actual 6-digit keypad code
- keypad/command/enabled: Set to 1 to enable the code, 0 to disable
- keypad/command/action: The action to execute. Possible values are add, delete and update

To modify keypad codes, the first four parameter nodes have to be set depending on the command:

- To add a code, set name, code, enabled **
- To delete a code, set id
- To update a code, set id, name, code, enabled

** Note: Rules for codes are:
- The code must be a 6 digit number
- The code can't contain 0
- The code can't start with 12

After setting the necessary parameters, write the action to be executed to the command node.
For example, to add a code:
- write "John Doe" to name
- write 111222 to code
- write 1 to enabled
- write "add" to action

## GPIO lock control (optional)

The lock can be controlled via GPIO. To enable GPIO control, go the the "GPIO Configuration" page where each GPIO
can be configured for a specific role:

- Disabled: The GPIO is disabled
- Input: Lock: When connect to Ground, a lock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlock: When connect to Ground, an unlock command is sent to the lock
- Input: Unlatch: When connect to Ground, an unlatch command is sent to the lock 
- Input: Electric strike actuation: When connect to Ground, an electric strike actuation command is sent to the opener (open door for configured amount of time)
- Input: Activate RTO: When connect to Ground, Ring-to-open is activated (opener)
- Input: Activate CM: When connect to Ground, Continuous mode is activated (opener)
- Input: Deactivate RTO/CM: Disable RTO or CM, depending on which is active
- Output: High when locked: Outputs a high signal when the door is locked
- Output: High when unlocked: Outputs a high signal when the door is unlocked
- Output: High when motor blocked: Outputs a high signal when the motor is blocked (lock)
- Output: High when RTO active: Outputs a high signal when ring-to-open is active (opener)
- Output: High when CM active: Outputs a high signal when continuous mode is active (opener)
- Output: High when RTO or CM active: Outputs a high signal when either ring-to-open or continuous mode is active (opener)
- General input (pull-down): The pin is configured in pull-down configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- General input (pull-up): The pin is configured in pull-up configuration and its state is published to the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic
- Genral output: The pin is set to high or low depending on the "gpio/pin_x/state" topic

Note: The old setting "Enable control via GPIO" is removed. If you had enabled this setting before upgrading to 8.22, the PINs are automatically configured to be
compatible with the previously hard-coded PINs.


## Connecting via LAN (Optional)

If you prefer to connect to the MQTT Broker via LAN instead of WiFi, you either use one of the supported ESP32 modules (see about section above),
or wire a seperate Wiznet W5x00 Module (W5100, W5200, W5500 are supported). To use a supported module, flash the firmware, connect via Wifi and
select the correct network hardware in the MQTT and network settings section.<br>

To wire an external W5x00 module to the ESP, use this wiring scheme:<br>

- Connect W5x00 to ESP32 SPI0:<br>
W5x00 SCK to GPIO18<br>
W5x00 MISO to GPIOGPIO19<br>
W5x00 MOSI to GPIO23<br>
W5x00 CS/SS to GPIO5
- Optionally connect:<br>
W5x00 reset to GPIO33

Now connect via Wifi and change the network hardware to "Generic W5500". If the W5500 hwardware isn't detected, Wifi is used as a fallback.<br>
Note: Encrypted MQTT is only available for Wifi and LAN8720 modules, W5x00 modules don't support encryption 
(that leaves Olimex, WT32-ETH01 and M5Stack PoESP32 Unit if encryption is desired). If encryption is needed, Olimex
is the easiest option, since it has USB for flashing onboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Random WiFi disconnects
Unfortunately the ESP32 has problems with some Access Points and reconnecting fails.
As a workaround you can navigate to "MQTT and Network Configuration" and enable "Restart on disconnect".
This will reboot the ESP as soon as it gets disconnected from WiFi. Also, this reduces
the config portal timeout to three minutes to prevent the ESP being stuck in config
mode in case an access point is offline temporarily.<br>
If this still doesn't fix the disconnects and the ESP becomes unreachable, the
"Restart timer" option can be used as a last resort. It will restart the ESP
after a configured amount of time.

### Pairing with the Lock (or Opener) doesn't work
First, make sure the firmware version of the NUKI device is up-to-date, older versions have issues pairing<br>
Next, try erasing the flash and then (re-)flash the firmware. To erase the flash, use the espressif download tool and click the "Erase" button.
Afterwards flash the firmware as described in the readme within the 7z file.
<br><br>
Also, there are reports that ESP32 "DEVKIT1" module don't work and pairing is not possible. The reason is unknown, but if you use such a module, try a different one.
<br><br>
Reported as working are:<br>
[M5Stack ATOM Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit)<br>
ESP32-WROOM-32D (DEVKIT V4)<br>
ESP32-WROOM-32E<br>
<br>
For more information check the related issue:<br>
https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub/issues/39
<br><br>
Also, check that pairing is allowed. In the smartphone app, go to Settings --> Features & Configuration --> Button & LED and make sure "Bluetooh Pairing" is enabled.

### In Home Assistant, the lock is shown as unavailable

Make sure you are using at least version 2023.8.0 of home assistant. 
The HA developers have changes to the MQTT auto discovery which break support for older version, and NUKI Hub
has adopted these changes. That unfortunately means that older versions of HA are not supported anymore.

## FAQ

### NUKI Hub doesn't work when the Wifi on my NUKI Smartlock Pro 3.0 is turned on.

This is by design and according to NUKI part of the specification of the Pro lock: You can user either the built-in Wifi or a Bridge (whic NUKI Hub registers as).
Using both at the same time doesn't work.

### Certain functionality doesn't work (e. g. changing configuration, setting keypad codes)
Some functionality is restricted by the lock (or opener) firmware and is only accessible when
the PIN is provided. When setting up the lock (or opener), you have to set a PIN in the smartphone.
Navigate to the credentials page, enter this PIN and click save.

### Authorization data isn't published
See previous point, this needs the correct PIN to be configured.

### Using home assistant, it's only possible to lock or unlock the door, but not to unlatch it
Unlatching can be triggered using the lock.open service.

### When controlling two locks (or openers) connected to two ESPs, both devices react to the same command. When using Home Asistant, the same status is display for both locks.

When using multiple NUKI devices, different paths for each device have to be configured. Navigate to "NUKI Configuration" and change the "MQTT NUKI Smartlock Path"
or "MQTT NUKI Opener Path" under "Basic NUKI Configuration" for at least one of the devices.

### The battery is draining quickly.
This often is a result of enabling "Register as app" without using a NUKI Bridge together with NUKI Hub.
Doing so will cause NUKI Hub to constantly query the lock, and thus draining the battery.
To fix this, unpair NUKI Hub, disable "Register as app", and re-pair.<br>
Never enable "Register as app" unless you intend to use a NUKI Bridge in addition to NUKI Hub!

## Development VM

Since setting up the toolchain can be difficult, I've uploaded a virtual machine (vmware image) that is
setup to compile NUKI Hub:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUVYHDtxXAZOAfQ321iRNIwkqFwuDsBp/view?usp=share_link

User and password for the VM are both "nuki" and "nuki". The source is checked out at ~/projects/nuki_hub,
the cmake build directory is build. So to compile, run the following commands:

cd projects/nuki_hub/build<br>
ninja

To upload the image via serial port, run "ninja upload-nuki_hub". The serial device is defined in
~/.bashrc (Environment variable SERIAL_PORT), which you'll eventually have to adopt to your device.
